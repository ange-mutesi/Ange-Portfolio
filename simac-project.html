        <!--Introduction to the project-->
        <h3 class="heading-project">Context</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          During the 6th school semester, I collaborated with five other
          strong-minded students to improve SIMAC NL's, a software company in
          The Netherlands, onboarding process for international professionals
          coming to The Netherlands for work. <br>
          Our mission was to create a comprehensive onboarding program tailored
          to the unique needs of international hires. Through extensive research
          collaboration with SIMAC, and continuosly iterations, we developed an
          innovative product that not only addressed practical aspects but also
          emphasized cultural differences and encouraged new hires to step out
          of their comfort zone in a fun and engaging environment, challenging
          individuals to build relationships with their fellow coworkers.
        </p>

        </a>

        <h3 class="heading-project">Research Question:</h3>
        <p class="paragraph concept">
          “How can SIMAC become more attractive to non-Dutch people? ”
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The question above suggests that the current enviornment at SIMAC is
          rather exclusive, without huge variety in employee nationalities. The
          <b>aim</b> in the formulated collocation was to accept and embrance
          the broadness of the problem assigned while tailoring our research to
          a specific target group, <i>international professionals.</i>
        </p>

        <!--Explaining the approach used-->
        <h3 class="heading-project">Approach used</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Due to the complexity and broadness of the topic, we used the double
          diamond diagram method, ensuring that all stages off the process were
          centerly focused on users' needs while allowing continuosly iteration.

        <img class="project-image-sticky-notes" src="images/sticky-notes.jpeg" alt="sticky notes">

        <p class="paragraph">
          My goal was to
          <u>understand the employee's perspective on the onboarding process
            within the company.</u>
          Surprisingly, the language barrier, which I initially presumed to be a
          significant challenge, was not an issue. However, one user emphasized
          the importance of socializing with colleagues outside of the
          workplace. Which then proved to be a solid direction for the project.
        </p>

        <!--Results-->

        <p class="paragraph">
          Employing the technique of <i>affinity mapping,</i>I categorized
          categorized data retrieved from user's, grouping them based on their
          relevance to one another. Sticky notes filled the walls as we
          uncovered patterns and connections among the various ideas.
          Ultimately, a voting system was employed to determine the most
          prominent categories. As a result, the captivating hook of
          <b>socialization during the onboarding process,</b> was followed,
          considering the consistent relevance and emphasis the interviewees
          expressed in the research. This choice promises to provide a fruitful
          direction for future endeavors, as the transformative power of
          fostering connections among employees is recognized.

        <div style="background-color: #f3eeea; padding: 1rem">
          <h3 class="heading-project">First concept</h3>
          <p class="paragraph concept">
            A platform where new hires enhance their cultural differences
            alongside visualizing their backgrounds as well as forecasting and
            planning their career goals.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph">
            The idea was to create an environment that promotes awareness and
            appreciation of diverse cultures, enabling employees to gain
            valuable insights into different perspectives. Additionally, I
            envisioned providing guidance and support to employees in achieving
            their personal and professional goals, emphasizing the company's
            commitment to their growth and development. By combining cultural
            awareness and individual support, the concept aimed to enhance
            employee engagement and create a strong sense of belonging within
            the organization.

        <img class="project-image" src="images/pdp_sketches.PNG" alt="first sketches simac">
        <p class="paragraph">
          I focused on designing a personal development plan as part of the
          concept. The idea was to
          <i>
            provide employees with a platform where they could outline their
            goals and aspirations, and receive feedback from their managers on
            their progress and areas for improvement. </i>However, after gathering feedback from stakeholders, this particular
          aspect of the concept was discarded as they expressed some concerns
          about how the personal development plan seemed to veer more towards HR
          matters rather than being directly related to onboarding. <br>
          Although initially disappointing, I saw this feedback as an
          opportunity for growth. It allowed me to build upon the criticism and
          develop a more creative and straightforward approach, which will be
          explored next.

        <p class="paragraph">
          I was assigned to design the world map view as the homepage of the
          app. Opting for a minimalistic style, I incorporated smooth animations
          on the screen. The pin points on the map dynamically change as users
          scroll through the bottom cards. When reaching a specific card, a
          pop-up notification appears, presenting users with an intriguing daily
          challenge they are encouraged to follow.

          Initially, the vagueness of the project was intimidating, but with
          guidance and support, I gained the confidence to explore different
          avenues. It has completely shifted my approach to tasks, encouraging a
          more hands-on mentality rather than getting lost in refining minute
          details endlessly. <br>Recognizing the limitations of the topic and
          time constraints played a crucial role in enabling me to contribute
          proactively. Throughout the process, I realized the importance of
          action and building tangible elements rather than getting lost in
          excessive research and discussion. While I invested significant
          effort, I acknowledge that there is always room for improvement.
