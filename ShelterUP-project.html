        <!--Introduction to the project-->
        <h3 class="heading-project">Context</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            In a dynamic collaboration between Team Liquid, a leading esports
            organization, and Fontys University of Applied Sciences, a unique
            challenge was presented to second-year students. <br><b>The mission?</b>
            To conceptualize and develop a cutting-edge loyalty program product,
            inspired by the success of Team Liquid's own offering, Liquid+. This
            presented an exciting opportunity to dive into the intricacies of a
            real-world business and devise a customized loyalty program tailored
            to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction.

        <!-- The problem -->

        <h3 class="heading-project">What's the problem?</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
            In the realm of nightlife, a persistent challenge shadows the vibrant
            atmosphere of clubs and social gatherings. Whether accompanied by
            friends, family, or partners, people frequently encounter the
            exhausting process of ordering beverages. Long queues become a
            bottleneck, demanding time and energy that could be better spent
            enjoying the vibrant atmosphere.The struggle as the necessity to keep
            an eye on companions in the crowd adds an additional layer of stress.
            The fear of losing sight of friends or loved ones diminishes the
            overall enjoyment of the night out. As the night concludes, a new set
            of concerns emerges. The safety of the journey home becomes a
            paramount consideration. Navigating transportation options and
            ensuring a secure return often lingers in the minds of patrons,
            disrupting the seamless transition from a night of celebration to the
            comfort of home.

        <h3 class="heading-project">
            Approach used
        </h3>
        
        <p class="paragraph">
            The journey to revolutionize the nightlife experience unfolded through
            a careful and innovative application of the
            <u>Design Thinking approach.</u><br>
            Rooted in empathy, creativity, and user-centricity, this methodology
            guided every step of our process. By embracing the principles of the
            chosem approach, our work process ensured a holistic, user-focused
            approach that aligned with the dynamic and complex nature of the
            nightlife environment. This methodology empowered us to not only
            address the identified challenges but to innovate and elevate the
            overall club experience

            Talking with people...
        </h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
            To understand the intricacies of the nightlife experience, we
            conducted a comprehensive empathize phase using a dual-method
            approach:
            <u>qualitative (interviews) and quantitative research(survey).</u>
            My involvement in this stage was mainly in crafting survey questions,
            conducting interviews, and analyzing both quantitative and qualitative
            data. This hands-on involvement ensured a thorough understanding of
            the user experience.

        <!--What was retrieved from interviews/survey-->
        <h4 class="sub-heading">What did people say?</h4>

          <p class="paragraph">
            I wanted to comprehend the key elements of a succesful/great nightclub
            experience and how it compares to a terrible one. What are some of the
            challenges people face? What is their overall behaviour at nightclubs?
            How long do they wait at the bar to get a drink?
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph concept">
            -Quote from a user interview: “Although I don't go to nightclubs that often, I would be very
            relieved if there was a safer way to get back home.”
          </p>

        <!--Results-->

        <h3 class="heading-project">And now?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            From the preliminary studies, we understood that the main problems
            people encounter when going out to a nightclube included: <br>
          </p>
  
          <ul>
            <li>Long waiting time at the bar</li>
            <li>Lack of transportation back home</li>
          </ul>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Based on the aspects above as well as the client task of creating a
            loyalty program, ShelterUp came to life. A loyalty program designed to
            take anyone's clubbing experience to the next level, enhancing an
            appealing reward system and facilitating challenges people encounter
            at nightclubs.

            To conclude...
        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            This designed loyalty program app is not just a product; it's a result
            of extensive research that identified pain points of beverage
            ordering, social cohesion, and safety concerns. <br>
            By streamlining processes and fostering a user-centric approach, it
            brough a new concept to the table. While I am extremely happy with the
            results, I must say that the end-product can still benefit from
            improvements, mainly on aspects regarding the rewards offering and
            transportation options in the application.
